## Scalability Factor

This Architecture is optimised for large scale projects. If you are beginner who just started using react native, I would
suggest starting with a type based architecture and slowly switching to this architecture.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo, `git clone https://github.com/victorkvarghese/react-native-boilerplate.git <your project name>`
2. Go to project's root directory, `cd <your project name>`
3. Remove `.git` folder, `rm -rf .git`
4. Use [React Native Rename](https://github.com/junedomingo/react-native-rename) to update project name `$ npx react-native-rename <newName>`
5. Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies

6) Start the packager with `npm start`
7) Connect a mobile device to your development machine
8) Run the test application:

- On Android:
  - Run `react-native run-android`
- On iOS:
  - Open `ios/YourReactProject.xcworkspace` in Xcode
  - Hit `Run` after selecting the desired device
